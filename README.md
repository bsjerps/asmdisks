Manage block devices with UDEV

asmdisks provides a way to manage Oracle ASM volumes using Linux UDEV.
It is an alternative to Oracle ASMLib.
You can use a combination of entire disks, partitions or mapper
(including multipath) devices to configure as block devices for
Oracle ASM (or other purposes such as destructive IOPS performance testing)
Also supports DellEMC Powerpath and DellEMC ScaleIO volumes.
