.SH NAME
asmstat \- Wrapper for iostat that maps ASM devices
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B asmstat
[ \fI\,options \/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
A wrapper for iostat that translates \fI\,/dev/sdXX\/\fP devices into their
ASM device names.  Any options will be directly passed on to iostat.
.PP
It  uses  sed(1) to filter mapper devices and replace \fI\,/dev/sdX\/\fP devices
with \fI\,/dev/oracleasm/volX\/\fP so it shows more meaningful output than
plain iostat when using with asm(1)
.SH OPTIONS
The options are passed straight to iostat(1) and therefore 100% equal.
.SH EXAMPLE
asmstat \fB\-xm\fR 2
.PP
shows IO performance statistics for ASM and generic disk devices every two seconds.
